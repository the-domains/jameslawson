Well... Here we go.  The start of something new, although to be fair the only thing that's really new is this website. Many of you will know me as a DJ/Producer and you might have seen me play or have some of my music. Others of you will know me as a digital marketing manager.  I may have even have run a campaign or built a website for you.  However, unless you're a close friend or client of mine you probably won't know about this other thing that I do.

For the past five years I have had a little sideline in high performance coaching.  What I do is help people get the best out of themselves using a whole raft of tools from something called New Code NLP together with hypnosis and some other coaching techniques. It's been going pretty well, so well in fact that it is now a major part of my income each month.

Up to now most of my clients have come via referrals, so I figured it was about time that I took this passion of mine to the next level and visibly put myself out there. For the record, I've helped people get over things like panic attacks, stress, stage fright, fear of flying and insomnia. I've also coached people out of crappy self talk and depression into a place where they've really started to excel as great communicators with both themselves and others.

This is the bit that I really love, because it isn't all about "fixing" a problem.  Far from it.  In reality what ever people want to get over its usually because they actually want to do even better at something.  Showing people how to go into high perfomance states and utilise some of the models of excellence that are available is particularly rewarding. For example, sometimes just the smallest shift in someone can make all the difference enabling them to give a great speech at a wedding.

Anyways, that's my introduction.  If you'd like to read a little bit more about how I ended up doing this please do so and I'll be blogging regularly about anything that inspires me to do so. Till then, feel free to get in touch or check out some other testimonials.

Have a great weekend!
