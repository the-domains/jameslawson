            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Launching something new</h1><p>Well... Here we go.  The start of something new, although to be fair the only thing that's really new is this website. Many of you will know me as a DJ/Producer and you might have seen me play or have some of my music. Others of you will know me as a digital marketing manager.  I may have even have run a campaign or built a website for you.  However, unless you're a close friend or client of mine you probably won't know about this other thing that I do.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a090dcd3c9b79036e5b5a4ae8fa7932885424b6c.png"></article>]]></description>
