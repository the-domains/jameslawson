I really enjoyed listening through the old tunes and remembering days gone by.  Its incredible how it all started so small with producers making tracks on a shoe string budget before exploding into the phenomenon that it is today.</p><p>In the age of powerful laptops and the internet this once cottage industry has become the biggest global export that the UK has seen in 30 years. It changed the sound of your favourite pop star, the look of your favourte shop.

This club grew in stature as time went on first taking over legendary spots in London like KOKO (formally Camden Palace), Turnmills (The home of Trade), Ministry of Sound, and Brixton Academy before turning into a full blown 2 day electonic dance festival for 40,000 people on Clapham Common. Along the way the music style evolved into the sounds of today but the passion and dedication still remains.</p><p>OK, I'm a bit excited because that's exactly where I am going in a couple of hours, but that's not why I all mention this.  I mention this because who'd have thought that Damian and Anton would have achieved this all that time ago as they ran out of room for beers in the little fridge in their kitchen while people were dancing out in their backyard. To be honest, the thought hadn't even crossed my mind back then, but they'd thought about it.  They dreamed about it, and most importantly... they got on with it and they're still doing it!</p><p>People can achieve great things if they really want to. You might not have an interest in dance music at all, but that's not the point.  What are you passionate about? What can you dream up for yourself and for those around you. What's your quiet revolution going to be? Dream it up and then do it. I can't encourage the do bit enough.</p><p>You might not want to become the biggest export that the UK has seen in the last 30 years, but I bet there's a whole lot you have to offer and along the way they'll always be someone that can help you get there.  It really is one of the truisms of life that once you focus on something you want you suddenly start noticing opportunities appearing before you. Your job is to grab hold of them and then offer opportunities to others!</p><p>So what's your dream, let us know in the comments below.  Just by putting yourself out there you may find that someone sees your post and gets in touch with you.  You'll never know until you start procrastinating about procrastination and do it today.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21">In the beginning there was Jack</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
